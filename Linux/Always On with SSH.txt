Have a look at pm-action(8) and search for /etc/pm/sleep.d in section “FILES”. If one of these scripts returns with a non-zero exit status, suspension is prevented.

Updated instructions for clarity:

So create a file /etc/pm/sleep.d/05_ssh_keepawake.
Put a shebang (#!/bin/sh) and the code mentioned in the question in this file.
Set execute permissions on it:
chmod +x /etc/pm/sleep.d/05_ssh_keepawake
